🌟 Introduction to Java
Java is one of the most widely used, robust, and secure programming languages in the world.
It was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1995. Later, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation.

🧠 Key Features of Java
-Object-Oriented
-Everything in Java is treated as an "object" which makes the code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
-Platform Independent
-Java follows the principle “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA)
-This is possible because Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) — not directly on the operating system.
-Simple and Easy to Learn
-Java has a syntax similar to C/C++, but with simplified memory management (no pointers, no manual memory handling).
Secure
-Java has built-in security features like bytecode verification, sandboxing, and exception handling
-Robust and Reliable
-Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and a garbage collector to automatically free unused memory
-Multithreaded
-Java allows multiple threads (small programs) to run simultaneously for efficient performance.
-High Performance
-Though not as fast as C++, Java performance is impressive thanks to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers.

🔁 Java Program Lifecycle
Write Code – .java file

Compile – Converts to bytecode → .class file using javac

Execute – JVM interprets bytecode and runs the program using java command

🧾 Example Java Program
java
Copy
Edit
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
